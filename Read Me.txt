Asteroids-The Game!!! Basic Help and Set-Up Guide

Hey There! If you're reading this, then Mason finally gave you a copy of Asteroids-The Game!!!. 
Unfortunately, because of some computer logic, not all of the files are able to be saved in a single jar file,
which is why I (the narrator) am here! I am here for some FAQs, quick setup help, and puns.

"But Narrator," I hear you ask, "Why does the game need a folder? Can't you have just one file do all? Also, didn't Mason
write you?" Why yes, in a perfect world. But that's where the doo-doo is found. Mason implemented magic so that your scores
and settings are saved. That way, you don't have to remember to mute your game and get ousted by your teacher who you 
should be paying attention to instead of playing Asteroids-The Game!!!. 
The way it does this is with 2 functions: Reading and Writing. 
 - Reading: This is when the computer reads a file to know what to do.
 - Writing: This is when the computer records in a file what to remember later
Unfortunately, a jar file can only be read from, not written to. Like a class copy. That means that Mason couldn't save 
the game in the jar file, leading to ME:) 
The game can save to system files, but it needs a place to put its notes, metaphorically speaking. I'm here to tell you
how to do that in a few simple steps.

HOW TO DO THAT:
 1. Put the Asteroids-The Game!!! jar (and me?) in a folder. 
 2. Go into the folder.
 3. Right click a blank space in the folder.
 4. Move your mouse over 'New'
 5. Select Folder
 6. Name the folder "resources"
 7. Celebrate.
So long as you have a "resoures" folder in the same place as Asteroids-The Game!!!, you can read and save your data.
Playing the game is even easier.

HOW TO PLAY:
 1. Double click Asteroids-The Game!!!

If that doesn't work, panic.

FAQs:
 - Q: How do I Play?
 - A: Use the arrow keys to get to CONTROLS and begin reading.

 - Q: Why did you make this game?
 - A: I wanted to bring joy to the world, and an opportunity for extra credit ;)

 - Q: If I get enough points to get an extra life, 
      but the score displayed isn't caught up, and I die, 
      do I not get my extra life?
 - A: You will. If not, let me know and I'll fix it for later.

 - Q: How can I give feedback, bug errors, and advice?
 - A: Send me an email with the subject as "Asteroids - "+bug help, or feedback or whatever. 
      If it is a bug, try to take a photo of the bug, 
      possibly use command prompt to get the error text, and tell me what lead you to get the bug.
      If it is feedback or advice, give a quick synopsis at the top and a quick explanation.
      If it is advice, I would prefer a reasonably thorough explanation.
      In any case, I'll try to respond to all of them.

 - Q: How can I help support you?
 - A: Give me $$$ ;)

 - Q: How can I share this game?
 - A: If you have the original zip, send that. If not, make a backup of your scores and settings, move them outside of the
      resources folder, create a zipped copy of the game, and send that. 
      Then have the person give you a dollar and then give that dollar to me.

 - Q: Do you want money?
 - A: Yes

 - Q: I find the particles distracting. How can I turn them off?
 - A: You cant. >:) -(Bwah Hah Hah!!!)

 - Q: Aren't you Mason?
 - A: ...No?
